# SQL
A collection of my Python/SQL exercises and SQL protocols. SQL is an ongoing journey for me, and I like to refresh my knowledge about it regularly.
The projects so far: <br />
<br />
<ins> **Norbornadiene Conformer Generation in rdkit and ase:** </ins> is inspired by some problems I had during my PhD as well as a particular Chemistry article I read (I name it in the notebook) but is a bit too early steps in analysis in order to be chemically meaningfull (ask me about it if you wish). Rdkit and ase are the two chemical libraries in python I used for it. Here, I looked the first time into setting up a MySQL database and how to populate a database as well as querying from it. It taught me that the requirements of primary and foreign key vary between SQL languages and that it is far easier to find a median with pandas then with SQL. It was done in summer 2023. <br />
<br />
<ins> **German google searches:** </ins> was also done in summer 2023 to strengthen what I learned about MySQL/python intercepts. Basically, I found a bunch of German google search terms and was happy to figure out that they have a super strong seasonality to them - surprise. (I know, my kind of humour).
