# SQL
A collection of my Python/SQL exercises and protocols. It contains so far only two mini-projects how to manipulate and work with MySQL (from a Jupyter notebook). In the first project, I am looking on chemical conformer generation with rdkit, cluster them and calculate the energies for these conformers - I upload than the panda frames to and analyze the energies in SQL. In the second project, I am looking on some German Google search terms with apparent seasonality. I first analyze them in SQL a bit to then analyze and visualize their seasonality better in pandas.
